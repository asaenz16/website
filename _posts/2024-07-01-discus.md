In a previous post [click here](_posts/2024-06-09-comments.md), I showed how to add comments to this blog using *utterances*. 
The only drawback is that you must be logged in GitHub to post a comment.

Today, I'm trying to use *disqus* to add comments to the blog to see if it is better. [Click here for documentation](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1935528-jekyll-installation-instructions).
