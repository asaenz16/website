I want to add comments to the blog.

Using "utteramnces" plug-in for GitHub.

## Documentation:

- Idea: [Post with different ways to add comments](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/165528/how-to-add-comments-in-blog-posts-on-github-pages-websites)

- Installtion: [Official website.](https://utteranc.es/#configuration) Note that it produces a html script at the bottom so you can create an html in your repo to add to your _includes folder.

- More deatails:
