I want to add equations. 

How about this?

$$\prod_{i=1}^{N}(x-x_i) = \sum_{k=0}^{N} (-1)^{N-k} e_k(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N) x^{N-k}$$. 

The coefficients $$e_k(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N)$$ are called the *elementary symmetric functions*. For example, we have

$$\begin{align}
e_0(x_1, \dots, x_N) &=1\\
e_1(x_1, \dots, x_N) &= x_1 +x_2 + \cdots + x_N
\end{align}$$
