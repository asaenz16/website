I want to add equations. 

How about this?

$$\prod_{i=1}^{N}(x-x_i) = \sum_{k=0}^{N} (-1)^{N-k} e_k(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N) x^{N-k}$$. 

The coefficients $$e_k(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N)$$ are called the *elementary symmetric functions*. For example, we have

$$\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
e_0(x_1, \dots, x_N) &=1\\
e_1(x_1, \dots, x_N) &= x_1 +x_2 + \cdots + x_N
\end{split}
\end{equation}$$

### How I added math

This was failry confusing process. I tried several things. In the end, I created a file _layouts/bease.html, where I copied the file from the minima GitHub repository [click here](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_layouts) and then I added the following scritp that I found [here](https://github.com/admshumar/math-minima/blob/master/_includes/head.html):

```
<script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML" async></script>
```
