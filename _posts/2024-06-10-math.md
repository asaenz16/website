I want to add equations. 

How about this?

\[ \prod_{i=1}^{N}(x-x_i) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (-1)^{N-k} s_k(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N) x^k\]

The coefficients $$s_k(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N)$$ are called the 

 {% raw %}
  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping! 
 {% endraw %}
